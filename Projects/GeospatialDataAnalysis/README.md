# Geospatial Data Analysis Suite

Welcome to the Geospatial Data Analysis Suite! This project comprises a series of Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate advanced data analysis and visualization techniques, specifically focusing on geospatial data. The suite includes tools for cleaning data, visualizing patterns, and analyzing time series within a geospatial context.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows, with each notebook designed to perform specific tasks within the data analysis workflow:

- **`plottaus_kyselylla_v7.ipynb`**: This notebook performs data visualization based on user queries, allowing for dynamic data exploration.
- **`plottaus.ipynb`**: Focuses on plotting geospatial data to identify trends and patterns visually.
- **`reitti_v4_xrajattu.ipynb`**: Analyzes specific routes or trajectories, possibly filtering out unnecessary data points based on x-coordinates.
- **`tunnit_paivat_kuukaudet.ipynb`**: Examines time-based trends by breaking down data into hours, days, and months for detailed temporal analysis.
- **Docker Files**:
  - **`docker-compose.yml`** and **`Dockerfile`**: Configure the environment to ensure that all dependencies are met and the Jupyter environment is ready for use.

## Features

- **Dynamic Data Querying**: Interactive notebooks allow for custom queries to visualize data according to user-defined parameters.
- **Advanced Visualization**: Utilize libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create detailed graphs and maps.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Specialized analysis of data over different time frames to detect patterns and anomalies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker: Ensure Docker is installed on your system to handle dependencies and simplify the setup.
- Basic knowledge of Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
