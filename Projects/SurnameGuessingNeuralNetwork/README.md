# Surname-Guessing Neural Network

## Description
Welcome to the Surname-Guessing Neural Network project! This project features a neural network trained to predict the nationality or ethnicity of surnames based on their linguistic characteristics. The neural network utilizes recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture implemented using PyTorch to perform classification tasks.

## Features
- **Surname Classification:** Given a surname as input, the neural network predicts the nationality or ethnicity it most likely belongs to.
- **Accuracy Analysis:** The project includes evaluation metrics to analyze the accuracy of the neural network's predictions.
- **Interactive User Input:** Users can input their own surnames to see how the neural network predicts their nationality or ethnicity.

## Project Structure
- **main.py:** Contains the main script to run the neural network, input surnames, and display predictions.
- **data/:** Directory containing surname datasets used for training and evaluation.
- **models/:** Directory containing trained neural network models.
- **utils.py:** Utility functions for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and user input handling.
- **requirements.txt:** File listing all required Python packages and their versions for easy setup.

## Additional Information
- This project was created for educational purposes to demonstrate the application of neural networks in natural language processing tasks.
- The dataset used for training and evaluation includes a diverse collection of surnames from various nationalities and ethnicities.
- The neural network model architecture and hyperparameters can be customized and optimized for improved performance.
