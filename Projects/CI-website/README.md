# CI-Website Project

Welcome to the CI-Website project repository! This project features a web-based Compound Interest Calculator built using Flask, demonstrating basic web development concepts along with integration of Chart.js for visual data representation.

## Project Structure

This repository is organized as follows:
- **app.py**: The Flask application file with all the backend logic including routing and form handling.
- **templates/**: Contains the HTML file that structures the web page.
  - `index.html`: The main page of the web application, which includes forms and visualization.
- **static/**: This folder contains the CSS stylesheet and potentially other static resources like images or JavaScript files.
  - `style.css`: Contains styles for the web application.

## Features

- **Compound Interest Calculation**: Users can calculate the future value of investments based on inputs like principal amount, interest rate, investment duration, and monthly contributions.
- **Interactive Charts**: Utilizes Chart.js to dynamically display the growth of the investment over time.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up a local development environment and run the application.
